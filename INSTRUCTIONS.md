## Materials Needed
- 3D printer
- Filament (PLA recommended)
- Sandpaper (optional, for smoothing)
- Wall mounting hardware (optional, if you plan to hang the stand)

## 3D Printing Instructions
1. **Download the Files**:
   - Clone this repository or download the ZIP file from GitHub.
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/MakamDevansh044/3d-printed-cell-phone-stand.git
     ```

2. **Prepare the Printer**:
   - Ensure your 3D printer is properly set up and calibrated.
   - Load the filament into your printer.

3. **Slice the Model**:
   - Open your slicer software (e.g., Cura, PrusaSlicer).
   - Import the `model/model.stl` file.
   - Adjust print settings:
     - Layer height: 0.2 mm
     - Infill: 20%
     - Supports: Yes (if necessary, depending on your printer’s capability)
     - Print speed: 50 mm/s

4. **Start Printing**:
   - Begin the print and monitor the first few layers to ensure proper adhesion.
   - Depending on your printer and settings, the print time may vary.

5. **Post-Processing** (optional):
   - Once the print is complete, carefully remove the stand from the print bed.
   - If needed, use sandpaper to smooth any rough edges or remove support material.

## Assembly Instructions
The cell phone stand is designed to be printed as a single piece and requires minimal assembly. If you plan to mount it on a wall, follow these additional steps:

1. **Prepare the Wall**:
   - Choose a suitable location for mounting.
   - Mark the position for screws or adhesive hooks.

2. **Mount the Stand**:
   - If using screws, drill holes into the wall at the marked positions.
   - Attach the stand to the wall using screws or adhesive hooks, ensuring it is securely mounted.

## Usage Instructions
1. **Vertical Orientation**:
   - Place your phone in the vertical slot of the stand.
   - Ensure it sits securely and is balanced.

2. **Horizontal Orientation**:
   - Place your phone in the horizontal slot.
   - Adjust the angle if needed for optimal viewing.

3. **Wall-Mounted Use**:
   - Hang the stand on the wall-mounted hooks or screws.
   - Place your phone in either the vertical or horizontal slot as needed.

## Troubleshooting
- **Poor Print Quality**:
  - Check your printer’s calibration and settings.
  - Ensure the print bed is level and clean.
  - Adjust the print speed and temperature if necessary.

- **Stand is Unstable**:
  - Ensure the stand is placed on a flat surface.
  - Verify the infill percentage and print strength.

- **Wall Mount Issues**:
  - Double-check the mounting hardware and wall material.
  - Ensure the stand is securely attached to the wall.
